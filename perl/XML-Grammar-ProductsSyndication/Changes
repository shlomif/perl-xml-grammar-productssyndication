Revision history for XML::Grammar::ProductsSyndication

        - Added the "disable" attribute to the "isbn" tag, and added
        support for it everywhere.
        - Converted from Moose to Class::Accessor, because Moose does not
        install cleanly on cygwin and is an overkill for our needs.
        - Added support for the <rellink /> tag that creates a relevant
        link (such as wikipedia page, IMDB link, etc.)
        - Added the support for the "appendtoc" tag to append a
        table-of-contents.
