Revision history for XML::Grammar::ProductsSyndication

        - Corrected the Module::Build-derived class in Build.PL from
        Test::Run::Builder to XML::Grammar::Builder. This was an oversight
        that resulted in the class not being installed.

        - Adapted the Build.PL to properly install files in case we
        don't install under /usr . We are currently using the
        install_destination("lib") to determine a suitable place.
            - To do: extract that logic into a separate class.
        - Extracted the extradata installation logic into a separate class
        under inc/XML/Grammar/Builder.pm for easy encapsulation and
        sharing among the different XML::Grammar::* projects.
        - Fixed the tests' failures due to the fact that blib/extradata
        is no longer generated.

        - Added the "disable" attribute to the "isbn" tag, and added
        support for it everywhere.
        - Converted from Moose to Class::Accessor, because Moose does not
        install cleanly on cygwin and is an overkill for our needs.
        - Added support for the <rellink /> tag that creates a relevant
        link (such as wikipedia page, IMDB link, etc.)
        - Added the support for the "appendtoc" tag to append a
        table-of-contents.

        - Added the ability to download Amazon.com images.

        - Created the skeleton of the module using module-starter. 
        - Implemented the basic XSLT + DTD functionality.
